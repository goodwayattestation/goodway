									Home department is headed by a principal secretary. It is an
									interior ministry mainly responsible for the maintenance of
									internal security and domestic policy. For purposes of
									authentication of documents, the HRD ministry delegated the
									responsibility to the respective Home Departments of each
									state after 2005. HRD attestation process is mandatory for
									higher education purposes.
								</p>
								<p className="t-a:j xs-mt-18 md-mt-24 f-w:500">
									It is the critical initial step of certificate attestation.
									All the documents meant for attestation / apostille must be
									attested by the home department. Out of this 80% of the
									documents are attested by the Maharashtra Home Department.
									Otherwise known as Mantralaya. The main reason of this being
									that Mantralaya has been a point for attestation from the very
									beginning. The ease and acceptability of Mantralaya
									attestation at many embassies make it a popular choice. For
									Indian consulate attestation, the home department of the
									state, where the document originated, its attestation must be
									obtained and is compulsory.

											With the onset of globalization and increased outflow of
											Indian migrants, the HRD ministry of New Delhi delegated
											this responsibility to the respective Home Departments of
											each state. Hence HRD attestation from New Delhi is no
											longer required but instead Home Departments Attestation
											is required but the name still remains. In case of UAE and
											Oman; state Home Department Attestation is not necessary
											but in case of Saudi Arabia, it is compulsory where the
											HRD Ministry in New Delhi delegated this responsibility to
											the respective Home Departments of each state, an
											exception was made in the case of two states namely Kerala
											and Karnataka. In both these states the concerned Home
											Department created a special department called as Regional
											Authentication Centers or RAC. The RAC of Kerala is called
											as NORKA Roots.
										</p>
										<p className="xs-mt-12">
											The procedure and time frame for Home Department
											Attestation / HRD Atestation varies from state to state
											for e.g. Documents originating from Tamil Nadu go to the
											university for verification and depending upon the
											university and age of the certificate time frames may
											vary. In case of Kerala, usually the documents are
											attested and returned on the same day. In some cases even
											the money (to be paid as a DD) will vary again depending
											upon the age of the Document and the university. For e.g.
											Maharashtra.
