										Apostille is an international treaty drafted by the Hague
										Conference on Private International Law. It specifies the
										modalities through which a document issued in one of the
										signatory countries can be certified for legal purposes in
										all the other signatory states. A certification under the
										terms of the convention is called an apostille. It is an
										international certification comparable to a notarisation in
										domestic law, and normally supplements a local notarisation
										of the document. If the convention applies between two
										countries, such an apostille is sufficient to certify a
										document's validity, and removes the need for
										double-certification, by the originating country and then by
										the receiving country.
									</p>
									<p className="xs-mt-12">
										Apostille is an international attestation that is acceptable
										in about 112 countries, and most of the western world
										recognises Apostille Only original documents duly
										authenticated by the designated authorities of the State
										Governments / Sub-Divisional Magistrate are Apostilled by
										the Ministry of External Affairs. Apostille is done on the
										reverse side of the original document.
