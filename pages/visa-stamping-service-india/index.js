                                    Visa is a written permission to indicate that a person is prima facie permitted to
                                    enter a particular country (subject to the final approval of the Immigration
                                    Official at the time of actual entry). It has more than sufficient experience and
                                    expertise for preparation of visa applications and submission to the concerned
                                    countryâ€™s Embassy / High Commission or Consulate. Goodway also keeps latest &
                                    updated information on the eligibility, documentary requirements and prescribed fees
                                    for different categories of visa applications for each country.

                                    The visa stamp placed in your passport by a Embassy or Consulate shows the period
                                    during which you may enter the particular country. If the date on the visa stamp
                                    expires while you are in that country., it need not be renewed until after you leave
                                    the country and wish to return again, provided that you maintain your legal status
                                    throughout your entire stay in country. This means that you must possess a valid
                                    visa document at all times. The visa document is only valid if you remain in
                                    full-time student status.
