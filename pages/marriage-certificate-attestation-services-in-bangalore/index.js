                <b>Procedure for Marriage Certificate Attestation </b>
              </p>

              <p className="xs-mt-12 md-mt-18">Personal document attestation is not a simple procedure. There are a few steps that must be accomplished before final attestation. It starts with a notary certificate and finishes with an <b>embassy</b> or <b>consulate certificate</b>. The following is the detailed procedure for <b>marriage certificate attestation in India:</b></p>

              <p className="xs-mt-12 md-mt-18">
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Notary Attestation:</b> It is the initial step in the attestation of personal and educational documents in <a href="https://goodwayattestation.com/marriage-certificate-attestation-services-in-bangalore/">marriage certificate attestation in Bangalore</a>. All additional procedures comprising the course of action are completed before certification by a notary. It's commonly received in the form of a signature and a stamp from the local notary. The notary is the most important requirement of any law when it comes to the verification process.</li>
                  <li><b>Home Department Attestation:</b> It is the second step in the process of legalizing personal documents for <a href="https://goodwayattestation.com/">marriage certificate attestation in India</a>. Certification of personal documents is handled by the <b>State Home Department</b>. The Home Department is only allowed to verify personal documents, and the authorities on the job are the only ones who can certify them.</li>
                  <li><b>SDM Attestation: </b> The Sub-Divisional Magistrate is a variant of the Home Department and, in some cases, the HRD. Some authorities, however, insist on <a href="https://goodwayattestation.com/state-hrd-home-department-attestation">HRD verification for educational documents</a>. The Sub-Divisional Magistrate is a separate entity from the state government that acts independently.</li>
                  <li><b>MEA Stamp:</b> <b>The Ministry of External Affairs</b>, or <b>MEA</b>, is the final stage of legalization from the home government, after which the document is stamped with an <a href="https://goodwayattestation.com/mea-attestaion-apostille-services">MEA stamp</a>. MEA is the government's central authority in charge of the country's external affairs.</li>
                  <li><b>Embassy Attestation: </b> Personnel from the country whose documents are being certified undertake this task. After <b>the Ministry of External Affairs</b>, it is the last level of <b>marriage certificate attestation</b> for most countries.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <p className="xs-mt-12 md-mt-18">
                <b>How long does it take to acquire an attestation of a marriage certificate?</b>
              </p>

              <p className="xs-mt-12 md-mt-18">The length of time required is determined by several factors, including the country for which the <a href="https://goodwayattestation.com/">marriage certificate attestation</a> is required, the type of documents required, and the state from which the attestation is required. <b>It typically takes 8 to 10 days to finish</b>. However, it can extend for a few weeks longer than a month. The mentioned factors will continue to influence the overall time for <b>marriage certificate attestation in India</b>.</p>
